# Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

# 1.Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
  SE  is the process of designing, developing, testing and maintaining software.
                # Importance of Software Engineering:
      Ensures software is built systematically and meets quality standards.
          Helps manage complexity in large-scale projects.
                Reduces risks and costs by identifying issues early in the development process.
                      Enables the creation of innovative and impactful software solutions.

# Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
  1. The foundational Phase (1940s-1970)
      This phase marked the birth of software engineering, starting with early programming on machines like ENIAC and the introduction of high-level languages like FORTRAN. The term "software engineering" was formally coined in 1968, emphasizing the need for systematic approaches to manage growing complexity. Structured programming and modular design emerged as key methodologies, laying the groundwork for disciplined software development.
  2. The Expansion and Diversification Phase (1980s–2000s)
      This era saw rapid advancements, including the rise of object-oriented programming (OOP), which revolutionized software design with reusable and modular code. The internet boom in the 1990s shifted focus to web development, while the 2000s introduced Agile methodologies and DevOps, enabling faster, more collaborative, and iterative development processes.
  3.  The Expansion and Diversification Phase (1980s–2000s)
      This era saw rapid advancements, including the rise of object-oriented programming (OOP), which revolutionized software design with reusable and modular code. The internet boom in the 1990s shifted focus to web development, while the 2000s introduced Agile methodologies and DevOps, enabling faster, more collaborative, and iterative development processes.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
